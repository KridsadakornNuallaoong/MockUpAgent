# MockUpAgent
## Overview

MockUpAgent is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI system built with LangChain and Hugging Face. It combines the power of large language models with retrieval capabilities to provide intelligent, context-aware responses.

### Key Features

- **Agentic Architecture**: Autonomous decision-making powered by LangChain agents
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Enhanced responses using document retrieval
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Leverages state-of-the-art models and embeddings
- **MCP Compliance**: Follows the Model Context Protocol standards

### Technologies

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **Hugging Face**: Pre-trained models and embeddings
- **Model Context Protocol**: Standardized agent communication
